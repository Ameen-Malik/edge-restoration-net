## ðŸ”¬ Model Architecture

The model consists of three main components:
1. **Encoder**: Downsamples the image through convolutions
2. **Middle Layer**: Processes features at lower resolution
3. **Decoder**: Upsamples back to original resolution
4. **Edge Detector**: Integrated Sobel edge detection
